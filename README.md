# Welcome to Parking Lot Problem
I have implemented the Parking Lot problem in C# Language as a .NET Core 3.1 Console Application
It works on Windows, macOS and Linux.
## Project Requirements
* [Visual Studio 2019](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/) 
  or
* .Net Core SDK and .Net Core Runtime
### Step 1
  Now open Visual Studio  and use shortcut key Ctrl+Shift+O to open the project. After using the shortcut key, Visual Studio will open up a dialog box. Using that dialog box, navigate to our Parking_lot  directory and select the Parking Lot Problem.sln file and then click on Open button.
